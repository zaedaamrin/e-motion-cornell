About section:

E.Motion is a performance group that performs K-pop dance covers. All those who are interested in dancing or K-pop are welcome. We hope to showcase our passion for K-pop songs and dances through our performances to the Cornell community.

(E.Motion is Cornell University's Korean Pop dance group! We do not hold auditions, and are instead focused on teaching members of all dance backgrounds and preparing them for performances.)
** ^can alternatively use this as the introduction**

Our club provides opportunities for dancers to challenge themselves; we regularly host workshops, which are open to the general public, and have audition-free group dances, as well as organize audition-only performance teams.

We have performed at many major Cornell events as well as at KCON New York, Stage K Cover Challenge and have won global dance cover contests hosted by 1theK.

E.Motion was voted Cultural Contributor at the 2018 CDA Awards and best Video Editing at the 2019 Awards..
