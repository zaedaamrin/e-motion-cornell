          <p>We are Cornell’s K-Pop dance group! We teach members of all levels and hold workshops, make socials, and perform for the Cornell community. Outside of that, we also film covers to go online!</p>

        <div id="#accordion-content-2" class="content hidden">
          <p>No auditions are required to join E.Motion! You can participate and perform in group dance. The only auditions are to join a performance team or fast cover.</p>

      <div class="container"> <!-- Accordion container -->
        <button id="#accordion-header-3" type="button" class="header"><strong>Q: How can I participate?</strong></button>
        <div id="#accordion-content-3" class="content hidden">
          <p>You can join Beginner/Group Dance, PT, or Fast Cover, or attend a workshop (workshops are announced on weekly basis in our newsletters).</p>

        <div id="#accordion-content-4" class="content hidden">
          <p>There's no cut -- just come to practice every week! Beginner/group dance allows you to perform alongside normal PTs and are slower paced. As beginner dance, we break down the moves in more detail.</p>

        <div id="#accordion-content-5" class="content hidden">
          <p>PT: Performance Team
          <p>CL: Choreo Leader </p>
          <p>Season: A round of dances; each season has 3-4 dances (synonymously used with ‘round’)
          Each semester usually has 1-2 seasons.</p>

        <div id="#accordion-content-6" class="content hidden">
          <ol>
            <p>First, songs are suggested. At the beginning of each season, every CL submits to E.Board three songs they are willing to teach as PTs.</p>
            <p>Next, is the Voting Period. We send out a voting form to all members.</p>
            <p>Finally, PTs are determined. The PTs for the season are determined by E.Board based on the top-voted songs, practice space, and CL availability.</p>
            <p><strong>This process repeats every season!</strong></p>
          </ol>

        <div id="#accordion-content-7" class="content hidden">
          <ol>
            <li>Go to workshop
              - First  practice will act as a workshop and we will  teach you the chorus of the song. Either go just for fun or to try out for the PT!</li>
            <li>Allow yourself to be filmed
              - This is so choreo leaders can see how much you’ve learned or improved on so that they can judge whether you fit the song!</li>
            <li>Wait for the results
              - If you get in and are sure that you can make all the practices (or give before notice if a day is impossible), accept!</li>
            <p><i>NOTE: Each person  is limited to a maximum of 2 PTs per ‘season’. This includes being backup in a PT as well.</i></p>

        <button id="#accordion-header-8" type="button" class="header"><strong>Q: What makes PT different?</strong></button>
        <div id="#accordion-content-8" class="content hidden">
          <p>There's more responsibility and mandatory practices. Being on-time for events is critical. You must have the ability to practice by yourself.</p>

          <p>They finish at a faster pace (usually within one week). They require high time commitment.</p>
          <p>Workshops/auditions are available for everyone!</p>
