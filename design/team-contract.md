# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remoce or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    We are committed to creating a responsive website that will meet the goals of our client.
    We will be sure to submit our own work and to cite any external resources. Our group also pledges to incorporate some interactivity in our website.


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    We agree to complete and contribute to the project evenly.
    If any issues arise, we will communicate that with our team members.
    We agree to complete our work in a timely manner, be prepared for milestone submissions, and be respectful of each other's time.
    If one team member is having difficulties, the other members will try to help them or they will seek help from the instructors and office hours.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    TODO

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    We will make sure to communicate frequently with our clients and reach out to them with emails and zoom meetings.
    We would also schedule meetings to meet with our clients in person in order to better meet their goals for our designs.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

    We can assign roles based on what pages members would like to work on.
    For example, if we are creating a website for a cafe one person could be in charge of the drinks page while the other person does food products. We can also perhaps pair members to review each other's code after every two to three days/commits.
    Therefore, the roles are: individual page, proofreader, and maybe more. (**Subject to Change**)

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    If one member is not delivering the work they promised, we will try to reach out to them individually and understand the situation. We will ask them what they tried to do/were able to finish and what external factors prevented them from contributing their entire part. If it is within reason, we will definitely try to support them, and redistribute the work. If it was unreasonable or occurs too often, we revisit the team contract and remind them that we all agreed to work as a team and that we are also graded individually on our contributions/work.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    When our members disagree, we agree to attend office hours and get a TA to help us choose the most appropriate idea.
    We agree to resolve disagreements fairly and we will work together to find the root of the problem and come up with the best solution.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    TODO

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    Whenever we meet a milestone, maybe we can treat ourselves to some boba or candy :D


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
