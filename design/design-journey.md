# Group Project: Design Journey

**You are encouraged to work ahead on everything on this project.** (Though we suggest you hold back on the interactivity until Project 3.) **Each section is required for a specific milestone. You are required to have these sections completed before that milestone's deadline.**

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

**Be clear and concise in your writing.** Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


# Client (Milestone 1)

## Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

    E.Motion is Cornell's only K-Pop dance group. Their purpose is to create an open environment for people to teach and learn actual K-Pop dances. They do dance covers, have live performances, and hold showcases. They film their performances and post those recordings to their social media (Instagram and Facebook) and YouTube channel. They have showcases every semester as an opportunity for their members to show off what they learned throughout the semester.

2. What makes your organization and its services different or unique?

    Compared to other dance troupes at Cornell, E.motion is completely open to all levels of dancers, even if it is their first time dancing. They focus on being inclusive to dancers at all stages, from absolute beginners to experienced dancers. Also, unlike other dance clubs that might be hip-hop-based or contemporary, their genre is KPop, which is uncommon at Cornell.

3. Why are you looking for a new website?

    They would look for a website because E.Motion has a YouTube and two social media accounts, but not a website. This is a struggle because when they get a lot of outreach from sponsors or other dance groups at Cornell (or from other schools) for making an event or collaborating, all of their information and content is scattered. It would be nice to have one consolidated place for them to get E.Motion's information. It would also solidify their brand and let them customize their website's look, whereas on their social medias, they don't have that kind of control on the appearance. Moreover, it would give them a space on the web that would be more convenient to direct people to it.

4. What are your goals for this site and what kind of information about E.Motion do you want to share through it?

    For the website, they want to share E.Motion's history on how it started and also share about their team members and everyone who is part of it. They also want to share events they hold because they have a lot of workshops and other events happening constantly. It would be nice to have one place to display the times for all of their workshops, rehearsals, etc. because it gets messy very quickly. Having it link to their Google Calendar or making their Google Calendar more accessible would be nice. Also linking all of their social media accounts and YouTube video database is important for their users to find. A photo gallery of past events and team photos is something collaborators/sponsors ask to see.

5. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

    To preface, E.Motion has gone through a lot of inconsistent branding through the years, starting with pink and blue theme. Later it was just white, red, and blue (which are the Korean flag colors), and they mostly did whatever they wanted. This semester, they're just going with whatever color scheme.
    For their website, however, the color scheme should be reds, blues, and whites that reflect the flag of Korea. In those colors, the shades used in the website can be pastel shades.

    Her overall goal for the site is to convey is a welcoming vibe and make an open atmosphere. She doesn't want to be intimidating to new people and wants everyone to freely express their interest in KPop and not be nervous to dance. They want to incorporate that this genre's niche/quirkiness into the design as well. The feel might be messy, but the goal is to convey their club's happy vibes.

6. Who do you want to visit your site? Who is your site's target audience?

    Their target audience is two groups: people who are interested in working with E.Motion such as sponsors, other dance groups seeking to collab, etc. Their goal is for them to see the info they need all there instead of jumping between their social medias or being unaware of their other medias.
    The second target group is new people who are on the fence about dance and who might be intimidated to come to one of their workshops.

7. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

    For the organizing with the collaborators and sponsors, E.Motion wants them to have access to their YouTube and social media accounts. The visitors might not know of all their other social medias or that their performances are posted in their YouTube. So, they want visitors to see all of their handles in one place and visit those for the videos or photos they might be looking for. Especially since they currently have to contact them directly to collect these resources.

    For newcomers, they want to show them, too, that there is the YouTube and Instagram and Facebook. They also want them to get the information on how the club works and how to join. They also want new people to sign up for their newsletter. They should also see the events and come to the events. Getting a feel of the club that convinces them to join the dance club or come to their events. They want these visitors to go on the website and see that the club is not as scary as a dance club at Cornell might seem. The visitor should see that it's a fun experience where everyone is there to have a good time and that there's no competition. The website should assure them that this is a space for them.

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' sites? Why?
(If they cannot think of a specific site, we can ask them to direct us to a social media account that has a style/content that they like.)

    She is not really familiar with other dance troupes or other organizations at Cornell.

    She liked the club, Breakfree's promotion for their showcase. It seemed down to Earth and had similar vibes.

    Also Cornell Creatives is another organization who's website she liked. She thought the organization of their content was logical and showed who's part of the team and their community well. It did a good job of displaying what an organization's website should encapsulate.

## Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is Cornell E.Motion. They are a K-Pop dance group that focuses on teaching people more about K-Pop dances by filming and posting their performances on social media where a lot of people can see it. Our clients meets the client rules because we are not the client, and there is no personal relationship with any of them. Another thing for why they fulfil our client requirements is that they do not have a website, which is something that can greatly help them reach more people who are interested.


## Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants. Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page.) Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

The client wants a website that is representation of them and what they do. The purpose the website is getting people to know more about their history, members and future events/ rehearsals on one place that is convenient. They would like to have their YouTube channel displayed on the website as well as their social media accounts so the users can reach out to them if they want or see the requirements for how to join the club. In addition, they want to include the background of their group and how it all started, which is something that will create a better connection between users and them and a gallery with their photos and videos for anyone to visually see how their group practices look.


## Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> Your project should be ambitious, but not too large. A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big. Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

The website we will be creating for our client fits well within the scope of this project because it will be a static portfolio of E.Motion's past performances and history and planned future events. This makes our project not overly ambitious, because the client does not expect any forms, user-logins, search engines, nor any centralized storage. Specifically, the forms they plan to use are Google Forms they will provide us and their "video database" is their YouTube channel that stores all of their recordings.

Moreover, the project is ambitious enough, because the website will consist of 4 content-full pages, one for each team member. The content is static and the client has agreed to provide us with the content, so we will be able to focus on structuring and organizing their content rather than generating content ourselves. There are enough "categories" of information they seek to display on the site, as in their history, their planned events, how they work, etc. This will be enough for each team member to be able to contribute to the website equally and build a project that is ambitious, but not too large.


## Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal A: Friendly environment
- Goal B: Open to collaborate
- Goal C: Get their users to know them better
- Goal D: Organization of their future rehearsals/events


## First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from the client meeting.

Gaby is the design chair for E.Motion, she is a fine art major at Cornell AAP.

K-Pop dancing focus group, organizes a lot of workshops where they teach people how to dance to specific K-Pop dances. They like to film their covers and post them to social media. Host one showcase every semester. Have one coming up, an opportunity for all performers to perform all the pieces that they have learned throughout the whole school year.

Sharing K-pop by teaching people how to dance.

**What makes your service unique from others?**
Compared to other dance troupes, they are completely open to everyone. You don't have to be an experienced dancer to come to a practice. The user can be a total beginner. Sets them apart in terms of exclusivity. Other dance groups focused on stylistic dancing. E.Motion focuses on K-Pop dancing. They don't come up with own choreography .It is a very focused group.

We would like a new website because E.Motion has a YouTube channel and social media. Gets a lot of outreach from different sponsors and other dance groups (inside and outside Cornell). Organizing groups trying to make a group happen. Needs a single space where to gather all information. Having a website strengthens and solidifies a brand. Getting to brand a club 100%. Help E.Motion set their own space on the Internet. Easier to refer to a single website rather than multiple social medias.

**What kind of goals?**
For the website they would like to share brief history about how E.Motion got started. Wants a team page for E-board members who let the events function and happen. Would be nice to have an events page. A lot of workshops happening and it gets very messy sometimes. Consolidated page. Link to a Google calendar and add event feature.

Overall goal to convey is a welcoming vibe and happy atmosphere. Don't make people feel intimidated to come and hang out with us. Freely express interest in K-Pop and feel comfortable hanging with people with similar interests.
Wants to capture the quirk of K-Pop. Clustered but fun. Happy vibes of dancing together.

**Target Audience?**
- People interested in working with E.Motion, other dance groups who would like to collaborate with them. Need all the information they need, rather than going through multiple social media sites.
- People interested in joining E.Motion .Especially those that are on the fence. Can be intimidating, so they want them to feel at home. Go on the website and feel confident that it doesn't look as scary as it might seem to be. Should be a fun experience, everyone is there to have a good time. No competitiveness among the people. Want to learn how to learn and dance along to K-Pop songs. "If you wanna have fun and try something new, this is the space you can do that"

When they visit your site, what kind of actions would you like them to Take
- Collaboration groups: Would like them to have access to their social media and YouTube more easily. Instagram, Facebook, everything should be accessible. Easier for them to fid the information that they need about the group as well.
- Many groups request photos of emotion, it should be easier to find them off the site. Industry practice to ask to use photos, but we want to make the job easier to collect info.
- Sponsorships: Show them that they have multiple medias that you can find as much information as you can.
- Newsletter: Comes out weekly or monthly. There should be a link to join if they wanted to.
- Events page: What's happening? Where? When?

Interesting if they had access to videos of them practicing before. Content that they would need to provide.

**Video Database**
Youtube links, photos of events performed at.

**Is there a certain feel you would like? Colors and imagery?**

E.Motion has gone through an inconsistent branding throughout the years. Started off with light pink and light blue theme. Then, was during white, red and blue colors (Korean colors). Did whatever afterwards. This semester there was no consistent theming or branding. Color scheme: reds and blues and whites. Reflect the flag of Korea. Pastels can be used.

What are your three favorite competitors or dance groups?
Not familiar with other dance groups at Cornell. Person interviewed is behind the scenes and makes infographics and posts them. Not too knowledgeable. They say they like BreakFree's recent promotion, interesting concept. Very down-to-earth. Aesthetic is very different from E.Motion but they have a similar vibe that they want to give off.

Cornell Creatives: Design lead for Cornell Creatives. Likes their website because it does all the things they mentioned before. How the products are performed. Who's on the team. Doing the basics of what a website should encapsulate.

Very grateful that we're willing to do this :) Mentioned that no one knew how to create a website on the E.Motion team, so they appreciate our offer very much.

# Site Design/Plan (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience. Be specific and justify why this audience is a cohesive group with regard to your client's site. This audience should not be overly broad nor arbitrarily specific. It should be a cohesive group with similar _goals_.

Their audience consists of three groups in Cornell's population:
- Other Cornell dance groups interested in collaborating
- Groups interested in sponsoring them
- Cornell students interested in joining their club or who could potentially attend their showcases or events

This is a cohesive group to our client's site that has similar goals, as they are seeking information to learn more about E.Motion. This information can include the club's contact information, upcoming events, or history.

### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project I am (re-)designing a web site for E.Motion. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10-15 minutes. You are free to quit at any time.

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

2. What is your favorite music/dance genre? What brings you to like this kind of music/dance (or not)?

3. Have you ever sought out information about these dances or music?
    - 3a. If yes, what information were you looking for? Did you find it? How did you access that information?

4. When you arrived at Cornell, did you seek out any information about this dance/music?
    - 4a. If yes, what was that information? How did you obtain it?

5. Have you ever been to a dance showcase (here at Cornell)?
  - 5a. Is there any information you wish you had known about the dance showcase beforehand or information that you weren't able to find?
  - 5b. What are your goals when attending a dance showcase?

6. When you look for information during a dance, where do you find this content? What type of device do you access to find this information?

7. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know? Do you have any lingering thoughts?

**After the interview:** This was really helpful. Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. Have a great day!


### Interview Notes (Milestone 2)
> Interview at least 4 people from your audience. Take notes and include those notes here. Make sure to include a brief description of each interviewee.

**Interviewee 1:** by Shania

**Description**: Sophomore in Arts and Sciences. Information Sciences major. Heard of E.Motion, have seen them multiple times in festivals on campus. Knows that they are a K-Pop group, but doesn't know what kind of section of K-Pop they perform.

**Responses**

2. I like rap the most. R&B is also good. Have been getting into K-pop and Korean R&B recently. What attracts me to it is the instrumental (more than the vocal). As for the Korean rap: instrumentals intrigue me as well.

As for dance: she doesn't really watch music videos or know dance routines often. She sees that K-pop music and dance is very polished and emphasizes clean routines. "Get millions of views". A lot of focus on the craftsmanship of everything.

3. Not really, only looking at Wikipedia or YouTube. Just listen to music, does not really research deeper.

4. Not really, listen to music casually. Intense in listening to music a lot but listening casually in that they don't know much about the artist. Not much interest in learning more about the bands, enjoys their content either way. More of a bystander, like watching more than doing.

5. I've been at Spring Fest, and a lot of Asian organizations. *Hope Night* recently, there were many dance groups when they performed. Haven't gone to specific events for dance only.

**5a.** Would like to know the line-up of performers. Has known the catering and overview but not specifics/time table of performances. Knowing performer line-up and booths helps. Information is not mentioned on the flyers. Didn't really find flyers or websites.

**5b.** Enjoys the different routines. Fun to support your peers in the activities and seeing that people are passionate about something. Also enjoys that they can express it for everyone to enjoy.

6. Information cards are scattered around but not that useful for finding what would specifically be happening that night. Only knew briefly. Short extent of what groups would perform.

Emails and newsletters with events help, but they don't have that much specific information about lineups to double check date/time/location. After that, she just sticks around with friends. If passing by, she stops for a few minutes and then leaves.

7. Not really. If there was a website with a line-up that would be helpful. Understands limitations though (last minute changes that can't be reflected fast enough), but she likes the idea of an initial line-up. Would be helpful.



**Interviewee 2:** (by Zaeda)

**Description**: Cornell junior, Human Biology, Health, and Society (HBHS) major in the College of Human Ecology. Is passionate about neuroscience and loves music. Played the flute for many years. Has heard of E.Motion from her friends. Thought the club seemed fun but does not know anything specific.
TODO: notes

**Responses**
2. She likes many genres of music: everything from instrumental (like Lofi), to pop, to kpop. She likes these genres because can match her moods depending on if she wants to study/focus or wants to be "hyped up to walk up the slope" etc.
For dance, she generally likes all genres of dance, but doesn't know much about any particular style.

3. Yes, she has sought information about these genres of music, specifically the names of artists of the songs she liked, and the other songs that the artists she likes produced.
She found this information by Googling it online or through her friends that regularly send her songs.

4. Yes, she looked into instrumental music when she came to Cornell, specifically different music ensembles on campus. She auditioned for symphonic band and is now currently part of a flute ensemble.
(a) She looked for information on the different ensembles that were offered at Cornell. For each of these groups, she looked for the expected time commitment, level of involvement, how serious/professional they were (or if they were more for fun). She gauged the last one based on the way the descriptions talked about the ensembles, as in the phrases they used. The professional ones used more proper diction and seemed more strict about attending concerts and rehearsals, while the fun ones were described with more casual words. She "just got the vibe"
She obtained the info from Google and Cornell's music pages and the Cornell class roster.

5. Yes, she has been to a dance showcase at Cornell (Hope Night).
(a) Yes, she wanted to know who was performing, because there was no available setlist she could find. She wanted to know what order they were performing in/what songs they would be performing, etc. She only knew one group, which was the group that her friend was in.
(b) Her goals were to see her friend perform and to enjoy the different acts that had "worked hard this semester to be there"

6. She did not seek any information during the dance showcase.

7. She thinks that the information she looked for when she was browsing Cornell ensembles are most likely what other people look for too, so it would have been helpful to a lot of people to include those details. She reiterated what this information should include: what the group does, how serious it is, how much time commitment, what options are available (like how to get involved), a schedule of when they are rehearsing and performing, and where these rehearsals/performances will take place.


**Interviewee 3 (by Alexandra):**

**description**
  - Junior in College of Engineering
  - Loves Korean culture, Korean food, Kdrama and Kpop
  - Has heard of E.Motion and has seen their performance at various events

**notes**
  2. I listen to lots of different genres, but I think ever since freshman year, I just really got myself into Kpop and it kind of grew on me ever since. I don’t really watch dance performances in general so I don’t have a favourite dance genre. But I guess with kpop, the music sort of comes with the performance side. I would never particularly look for or search up dance videos to watch before, but with kpop, it’s very natural for me to just watch the dance practices or whatnot as I listen to the music. So I guess I could say kpop is also my favourite dance genre considering I don’t watch any other dances.

  3. Yes! After I got into kpop and after hearing/seeing more artists and different groups, I’m often interested to search for more of their music and performances.
    - 3a.
    - I would look for different live performances, or stage in kpop terms, of the particular song I like. I also like searching up their dance practices. And I would just go to YouTube for these.

  4. Well I only began listening to them, like I said, after freshman year. Right. And it took a while for me to like them and start listening to them so I didn’t really seek out information about it at Cornell. I’m not that intense about music in that way so I never tried to obtain more information about participating I guess.

  5. I’ve never been to dance showcases but I’ve always seen them around at events with all these other clubs. Like there was this one event I think hosted by the club of taiwan, and I remember seeing dance performances there.
    - 5a.
    - Well like I said earlier, I’ve never gone to actual dance showcases but just those events that invited them to perform. But I think it would be cool to know what songs/dance the group are covering and who’s doing who’s part in the kpop group. Oh it’s probably also nice to know when during the event the groups will be performing because it’s never clear on the posters and we would always be waiting and wondering when they are going to come up.
    - 5b.
    - I’m there usually to support my friends or my friends’ friends.

  6. I don’t actively search for information about the dance. Like for the event nights, I’m usually just dragged by my friends and everything I know before I go is just based on what they told me. They would just tell me oh this dance group is doing a cover today and I might be interested…
  But I always see posters around campus and they usually tell a bit about what’s going on.

  7. I think it would be helpful to have what I said earlier (in 6) about who’s performing and when they are performing at the event (if not a solo club showcase) published somewhere so everyone who intends to go can see. That’s just what I’m thinking but yeah I don’t have anything else. Thank you!



**Interviewee 4:** by Marko

- **Description**
  - A freshman in College of Arts and Sciences, An international student studying Biology, likes listening to music in her free time and has never heard of E.Motion before.

- **Notes**
2. My favorite music genre depends a lot on my mood at the moment, but if I had to choose it would be EDM (Electronic Dance Music). What attracts me to it is the rhythm and the energy. She recently started liking K-pop after some of her friends at Cornell suggested some songs to her.

3. Did not look for information about, basically, whatever Youtube recommends to her, she is open to listening to new songs/ groups.

4. Yes because some of her friends are big fans of K-pop here at Cornell. She tried to find a group of people who are interested in K-pop but did not find anything, except a couple of accounts of K-pop groups on Instagram.

5. Yes, I passed by some K-Pop group's performance at Duffield Hall but I did not pay too much attention. Other than that she has never been to a dance showcase. She would like to go in the future with her friends.

- 5a. I wish I had known the details about future events or had a place where information is easily accessible so she and her friends could make a plan to go to some event. She saw some flyers but the information on the was too vague and catching her attention enough.
- 5b. Have fun spending time with my friends, enjoy the music and a dance performance

6. Usually on Instagram because many groups post information about their future/ current events and their performers on their stories but the stories expire in 24hourse so they can easily be missed. She always uses her phone because it's more convenient than using a laptop.

7. Not really, that would be it.


### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above. List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

#### Goal 1: Establishing Familiarity
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Laying out the design of the website so that it is easier to access information concerning details of events (date, time, location)
  - Utilizing bullet points and list formats for brevity and faster accessibility to information
  - This section could be labeled as "Upcoming Events" and could be placed under the "What We Do" page, and maybe even the homepage.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Interviewee 1 expressed the desire to know what performances would be hosted at certain showcase events. Being "in the know" of what, who, and when performances would host was heavily emphasized.
  - Meeting this goal would bring further satisfaction to potential webpage visitors, since they would be finding information that they would want the most.

#### Goal 2: Decision to Join
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - A list structure for information that potential members may seek while still deciding whether to join the club. This gathers all the information a student will need to be aware of before they join.
  - A dedicated section named "FAQs" with short questions and answers that are easy to scan and comprehend without too much effort.
  - Group photos dispersed around the site to give a visual representation of the club to potential members. This could communicate to new students intuitively what this club is like without requiring them to read anything. This creates less resistance in their decision-making process of whether to join.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
  - Interviewee 2 explained that in the process of seeking musical/dance clubs to join at Cornell, she sought very specific details like commitment level, "vibe" of the club in terms of professionality vs. "for-fun," etc. in her goal to determine if a group would be the right fit for her and to decide which one she would be joining.
  - Having an "FAQs" section provides vital information in one place on the site that users will be able to navigate to it easily and achieve their goal of understanding the club. Grouping the specific details that a new member will need to know before joining provides an opportunity to welcome them and give them a clear idea of what this club is like. It can aid them in deciding whether to join and possibly make them be more easily swayed to join the club.

#### Goal 3: Having Fun
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - A friendly and fun looking website with vibrant colors, images and videos for the "wow" effect but also has all of the information a user that is interested would like to know in order to make a decision whether or not they would like to attent a performance.
 - The information needs to be accesible and easy to find
 - Interactivity such as image carousels, hamburger drop-down menus will help create the dynamic aspect of the site which will further improve the "wow" effect
- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
- Interviewee 4 explained that one of the most important facts for her is to have fun with her friends at a dance show, so paying attention to how our dance group is portrayed on their website is of key significance. The website needs to be personal, i.e. provide a chance to users to meet/learn more about E.Motion for a good first impression, give them a glimpse of who they are and what they do so they can decide whether or not they can attend their future performance based on the given information on the site.


## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

**Plan your site's content.**

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List the content you plan to include your personal website. This should be a comprehensive list.

- Logo
- Navigation bar
- History of E.Motion
- Welcoming message
- Image Carousel
- Social Media links
- Contact information
- Video/recordings of their dance showcases/rehearsals
- Current member of their club
- Upcoming events
- Group Pictures
- Newsletter link
- Footer
- Mission statement


### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how its addressed their goals..

This content provides several aspects that are useful to our audience. First, a logo and a navigation bar are essential for a good-looking modern website and a welcoming message for making the site look friendly and pleasing. Secondly, the content will be split into four different pages to avoid overcrowding and possibly creating confusion because finding and accessing quick information is crucial to our audience, based on our interviews. Lastly, the history of E.Motion, together with group pictures, contact information, videos of their dance showcases, and upcoming events, will allow users to familiarize themselves with E.Motion, learn more about who they are, what they do, and most importantly, get a chance to reach out to them and get information about their next performance.



## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your iterations of card sorting here.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting and description of your thought process for each iteration.

1.
  ![card sort #1](/design/card-sort-1.jpg)
- Creating four pages that will organize the webpage best by content the user interviewees asked for.
- Carousel on homepage will immediately show pictures that the users have expressed the desire to see (performances, who is on the team, etc.). Essentially, creates an impact upon opening.
- Event dates under "What We Do" for easy access for people who may want to watch or join a performance.

2.
  ![card sort #2](/design/card-sort-2.jpg)
- Newsletter moved under "About Us" since it has more written content.
- Kept "What We Do" to focus on visual content.
- Added "Event Dates" to "Home Page" since this will be the first page to load when someone accesses the page. Event dates was one of the most requested information from users, so it may help to have this be immediately accessible.

3.
  ![card sort #3](/design/card-sort-3.jpg)
- Moving our team to the homepage to try to establish a sense of familiarity with the webpage visitor. This can create a more human experience by introducing the faces behind the productions.
- Newsletter kept under "About Us" since it has more written content. Keeping all reading-heavy material in a single location.


### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

Our group will be using **card sort #1** for the final content organization.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences and their goals.

  - As our client has indicated, the target audience of our site are **people who are interested in joining E.Motion** (new members to the club) and **working with E.Motion** (other clubs that would invite the club to different events) and also **other dance groups** (who are looking for a potential collaboration with E.Motion). Hence, by organizing the content into the four pages - home page, “what we do” page, “join us” page, and “about us” page - all target audiences are able to find the information they need.

    - For people who are interested but also on the fence about joining the club, they could go to the “what we do” page to get a better understanding of the dance group, perhaps what songs the club gets to perform, which artist’s dance/song the club gets to cover, etc. The “join us” page also provides information that are useful for this group of audience. On this page, they could access information that’s particularly about the joining process (such as dates and places for tryouts and callbacks) and they could also subscribe to the club’s newsletter for more information!


    - For people who are hoping to work with E.Motion and invite the club to participate in an event, they could also head to the “what we do” pagel. By browsing through this page, these people would be able to know more about the club and evaluate if E.Motion is their best choice for the event.

    - For the other dance clubs that are looking for a collaboration, they could also use the “what we do” page to see if the dance covers by E.Motion are well suited for their potential collaboration after checking out their past performance videos.



### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your personal website navigation.

- Home
- What We Do
- Join Us
- About Us

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience and their goals.

TODO: add in actual user goals lol
1. The name "Home" for the home page makes sense for our audience because it matches what is familiar to them. This means they will intuitively know what this page is and be able to assume what will be found on it without needing to think too hard.

This aligns with the *Establishing Familiarity* goal, since our audience voiced the need to easily access information. Using a website design pattern that has been used for now decades means that the audience will not struggle to navigate the webpage (or if this is new to them, they would still likely experience an easy learning curve).

2. The name "What We Do" for another page makes for the audience as it communicates that that page will aid them in their goal of finding information about what the club is currently doing. Since it is a dance group, users will assume this entails upcoming performances and events.

3. The "Join Us" page makes sense with this name because it conveys to users seeking to join the club will be easily navigate to, to find out all the information on how to join this club in one page.

This directly relates to the user's goal of *Deciding to Join*, as it indicates very simply and obviously that the information a non-member seeking to join the group is located on this page. The wording of this page's name is quite common and will be familiar to the user as well, which further accelerates their achievement of this goal.

4. The "About Us" page should be named so, because it is a common convention that the audience will be able to understand easily. This is also directly linked to their goal of learning about the club itself and gauging if this is the kind of club they want to join.

## Design (Milestone 2)

### Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.
> Note the theme you selected for you site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

#### Theme 1 - Simple
 - Simple, minimalistic
 - Color Palette: Red, blue, white (for flag of Korea)
 - Avoids overwhelming the user with content, considering that there is are many layers of information to sort through.
 - Especially helps with aiding a user in making a decision. It is very simple and plain, so they can consume more content without feeling overwhelmed.


#### Theme 2 - Welcoming
 - High contrast creates an invigorating atmosphere that welcomes the user. This complements our client's goals of establishing a site that does not intimidate its users.
 - Incorporating Royal blue (still in Korean flag hues), lighter aqua blue as shadow (inverse contrast). Will be using an Instagram post for reference.
 - White background avoids cluttering the provided space (similarly to the first theme proposal). Plain webpage background may also be more familiar to the user and therefore allow them to use the website easily.
 - Aligns with client's goal of creating a friendly, welcoming environment


#### Theme 3 - Dark theme
- Light black background: Sleek presentation of information
- Creates organization by not overwhelming the user with multiple colors.
- More professional look, might help convince prospective members to join the group (aligns with goal of making a decision).


### Interactivity Ideas (Milestone 2)
> Brainstorm several ideas for your site's interactivity.
> Provide a very brief summary how each idea improves the usability of the site for the site's audience.

**Image Carousel**
- Showcases a visual gallery of the E.Motion's team, practices, and performances.
- Meets goal of *Establishing Familiarity*, since users would then become more familiar with the faces behind the dance pieces. They may also then have a better understanding of certain performance features (example: extrapolating how complicated routines may be based on the images).
- Improves usability by conveniently gathering visual content in a single and accessible spot on the page (in this case, it would likely be at the top of the page, below the navigator).

**Accordion**
- Displays FAQs that potential members might ask/wonder about the club.
- Aids users' goal of **Deciding to Join** by providing answers to the questions that they might seek when they are judging whether the club will be the right fit for them and whether to join.
- Increases readability by decreasing textual clutter on the screen as it conceals text that answers questions that the user is not currently pursuing.

**Hamburger**
- Creates a more accessibly mobile experience. Users can click on a hamburger icon in order to access the navigation bar. This makes better use of the limited space provided on mobile display.
- The hamburger menu is also a common webpage design pattern, meaning that the users will be more familiar with how to utilize it. Aligns with familiarity goal.

### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the mobile and desktop versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

#### Desktop Layout Sketch
![Desktop Layout Draft](/design/desktop-layout-sketch.jpg)
- Carousel interactivity as the first thing to greet the user (creates a lasting, memorable impact)
- Logo in the left corner (familiar design)
- Navigation links displayed as separate buttons on the right side of the page
- Footer at the end of *every* page, as to assure the user that they are on the same website (creates cohesion)

#### Mobile Layout Sketch
![Mobile Layout Draft](/design/mobile-layout-sketch.jpg)
- Navigation links list replaced by a hamburger icon (less clutter on the page)
- Hamburger icon on the right side for easier implementation
- Written content that has images is now displayed in column mode (capitalizing on available space)

#### Footer Layout Sketch
![Footer Layout Draft](/design/footer-layout-sketch.jpg)
- Will be featured at the end of every page
- Should include primary contact information; easy to access for anyone who wishes to reach out for more information.
- Perhaps includes icons to popular social medias (that E.Motion has accounts on). Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
