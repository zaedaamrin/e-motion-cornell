# Group Project: Design Journey

**You are encouraged to work ahead on everything on this project.** (Though we suggest you hold back on the interactivity until Project 3.) **Each section is required for a specific milestone. You are required to have these sections completed before that milestone's deadline.**

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

**Be clear and concise in your writing.** Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


# Client (Milestone 1)

## Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

    E.Motion is Cornell's only K-Pop dance group. Their purpose is to create an open environment for people to teach and learn actual K-Pop dances. They do dance covers, have live performances, and hold showcases. They film their performances and post those recordings to their social media (Instagram and Facebook) and YouTube channel. They have showcases every semester as an opportunity for their members to show off what they learned throughout the semester.

2. What makes your organization and its services different or unique?

    Compared to other dance troupes at Cornell, E.motion is completely open to all levels of dancers, even if it is their first time dancing. They focus on being inclusive to dancers at all stages, from absolute beginners to experienced dancers. Also, unlike other dance clubs that might be hip-hop-based or contemporary, their genre is KPop, which is uncommon at Cornell.

3. Why are you looking for a new website?

    They would look for a website because E.Motion has a YouTube and two social media accounts, but not a website. This is a struggle because when they get a lot of outreach from sponsors or other dance groups at Cornell (or from other schools) for making an event or collaborating, all of their information and content is scattered. It would be nice to have one consolidated place for them to get E.Motion's information. It would also solidify their brand and let them customize their website's look, whereas on their social medias, they don't have that kind of control on the appearance. Moreover, it would give them a space on the web that would be more convenient to direct people to it.

4. What are your goals for this site and what kind of information about E.Motion do you want to share through it?

    For the website, they want to share E.Motion's history on how it started and also share about their team members and everyone who is part of it. They also want to share events they hold because they have a lot of workshops and other events happening constantly. It would be nice to have one place to display the times for all of their workshops, rehearsals, etc. because it gets messy very quickly. Having it link to their Google Calendar or making their Google Calendar more accessible would be nice. Also linking all of their social media accounts and YouTube video database is important for their users to find. A photo gallery of past events and team photos is something collaborators/sponsors ask to see.

5. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

    To preface, E.Motion has gone through a lot of inconsistent branding through the years, starting with pink and blue theme. Later it was just white, red, and blue (which are the Korean flag colors), and they mostly did whatever they wanted. This semester, they're just going with whatever color scheme.
    For their website, however, the color scheme should be reds, blues, and whites that reflect the flag of Korea. In those colors, the shades used in the website can be pastel shades.

    Her overall goal for the site is to convey is a welcoming vibe and make an open atmosphere. She doesn't want to be intimidating to new people and wants everyone to freely express their interest in KPop and not be nervous to dance. They want to incorporate that this genre's niche/quirkiness into the design as well. The feel might be messy, but the goal is to convey their club's happy vibes.

6. Who do you want to visit your site? Who is your site's target audience?

    Their target audience is two groups: people who are interested in working with E.Motion such as sponsors, other dance groups seeking to collab, etc. Their goal is for them to see the info they need all there instead of jumping between their social medias or being unaware of their other medias.
    The second target group is new people who are on the fence about dance and who might be intimidated to come to one of their workshops.

7. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

    For the organizing with the collaborators and sponsors, E.Motion wants them to have access to their YouTube and social media accounts. The visitors might not know of all their other social medias or that their performances are posted in their YouTube. So, they want visitors to see all of their handles in one place and visit those for the videos or photos they might be looking for. Especially since they currently have to contact them directly to collect these resources.

    For newcomers, they want to show them, too, that there is the YouTube and Instagram and Facebook. They also want them to get the information on how the club works and how to join. They also want new people to sign up for their newsletter. They should also see the events and come to the events. Getting a feel of the club that convinces them to join the dance club or come to their events. They want these visitors to go on the website and see that the club is not as scary as a dance club at Cornell might seem. The visitor should see that it's a fun experience where everyone is there to have a good time and that there's no competition. The website should assure them that this is a space for them.

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' sites? Why?
(If they cannot think of a specific site, we can ask them to direct us to a social media account that has a style/content that they like.)

    She is not really familiar with other dance troupes or other organizations at Cornell.

    She liked the club, Breakfree's promotion for their showcase. It seemed down to Earth and had similar vibes.

    Also Cornell Creatives is another organization who's website she liked. She thought the organization of their content was logical and showed who's part of the team and their community well. It did a good job of displaying what an organization's website should encapsulate.

## Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is Cornell E.Motion. They are a K-Pop dance group that focuses on teaching people more about K-Pop dances by filming and posting their performances on social media where a lot of people can see it. Our clients meets the client rules because we are not the client, and there is no personal relationship with any of them. Another thing for why they fulfil our client requirements is that they do not have a website, which is something that can greatly help them reach more people who are interested.


## Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants. Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page.) Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

The client wants a website that is representation of them and what they do. The purpose the website is getting people to know more about their history, members and future events/ rehearsals on one place that is convenient. They would like to have their YouTube channel displayed on the website as well as their social media accounts so the users can reach out to them if they want or see the requirements for how to join the club. In addition, they want to include the background of their group and how it all started, which is something that will create a better connection between users and them and a gallery with their photos and videos for anyone to visually see how their group practices look.


## Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> Your project should be ambitious, but not too large. A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big. Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

The website we will be creating for our client fits well within the scope of this project because it will be a static portfolio of E.Motion's past performances and history and planned future events. This makes our project not overly ambitious, because the client does not expect any forms, user-logins, search engines, nor any centralized storage. Specifically, the forms they plan to use are Google Forms they will provide us and their "video database" is their YouTube channel that stores all of their recordings.

Moreover, the project is ambitious enough, because the website will consist of 4 content-full pages, one for each team member. The content is static and the client has agreed to provide us with the content, so we will be able to focus on structuring and organizing their content rather than generating content ourselves. There are enough "categories" of information they seek to display on the site, as in their history, their planned events, how they work, etc. This will be enough for each team member to be able to contribute to the website equally and build a project that is ambitious, but not too large.


## Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal A: Friendly environment
- Goal B: Open to collaborate
- Goal C: Get their users to know them better
- Goal D: Organization of their future rehearsals/events


## First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from the client meeting.

Gaby is the design chair for E.Motion, she is a fine art major at Cornell AAP.

K-Pop dancing focus group, organizes a lot of workshops where they teach people how to dance to specific K-Pop dances. They like to film their covers and post them to social media. Host one showcase every semester. Have one coming up, an opportunity for all performers to perform all the pieces that they have learned throughout the whole school year.

Sharing K-pop by teaching people how to dance.

**What makes your service unique from others?**
Compared to other dance troupes, they are completely open to everyone. You don't have to be an experienced dancer to come to a practice. The user can be a total beginner. Sets them apart in terms of exclusivity. Other dance groups focused on stylistic dancing. E.Motion focuses on K-Pop dancing. They don't come up with own choreography .It is a very focused group.

We would like a new website because E.Motion has a YouTube channel and social media. Gets a lot of outreach from different sponsors and other dance groups (inside and outside Cornell). Organizing groups trying to make a group happen. Needs a single space where to gather all information. Having a website strengthens and solidifies a brand. Getting to brand a club 100%. Help E.Motion set their own space on the Internet. Easier to refer to a single website rather than multiple social medias.

**What kind of goals?**
For the website they would like to share brief history about how E.Motion got started. Wants a team page for E-board members who let the events function and happen. Would be nice to have an events page. A lot of workshops happening and it gets very messy sometimes. Consolidated page. Link to a Google calendar and add event feature.

Overall goal to convey is a welcoming vibe and happy atmosphere. Don't make people feel intimidated to come and hang out with us. Freely express interest in K-Pop and feel comfortable hanging with people with similar interests.
Wants to capture the quirk of K-Pop. Clustered but fun. Happy vibes of dancing together.

**Target Audience?**
- People interested in working with E.Motion, other dance groups who would like to collaborate with them. Need all the information they need, rather than going through multiple social media sites.
- People interested in joining E.Motion .Especially those that are on the fence. Can be intimidating, so they want them to feel at home. Go on the website and feel confident that it doesn't look as scary as it might seem to be. Should be a fun experience, everyone is there to have a good time. No competitiveness among the people. Want to learn how to learn and dance along to K-Pop songs. "If you wanna have fun and try something new, this is the space you can do that"

When they visit your site, what kind of actions would you like them to Take
- Collaboration groups: Would like them to have access to their social media and YouTube more easily. Instagram, Facebook, everything should be accessible. Easier for them to fid the information that they need about the group as well.
- Many groups request photos of emotion, it should be easier to find them off the site. Industry practice to ask to use photos, but we want to make the job easier to collect info.
- Sponsorships: Show them that they have multiple medias that you can find as much information as you can.
- Newsletter: Comes out weekly or monthly. There should be a link to join if they wanted to.
- Events page: What's happening? Where? When?

Interesting if they had access to videos of them practicing before. Content that they would need to provide.

**Video Database**
Youtube links, photos of events performed at.

**Is there a certain feel you would like? Colors and imagery?**

E.Motion has gone through an inconsistent branding throughout the years. Started off with light pink and light blue theme. Then, was during white, red and blue colors (Korean colors). Did whatever afterwards. This semester there was no consistent theming or branding. Color scheme: reds and blues and whites. Reflect the flag of Korea. Pastels can be used.

What are your three favorite competitors or dance groups?
Not familiar with other dance groups at Cornell. Person interviewed is behind the scenes and makes infographics and posts them. Not too knowledgeable. They say they like BreakFree's recent promotion, interesting concept. Very down-to-earth. Aesthetic is very different from E.Motion but they have a similar vibe that they want to give off.

Cornell Creatives: Design lead for Cornell Creatives. Likes their website because it does all the things they mentioned before. How the products are performed. Who's on the team. Doing the basics of what a website should encapsulate.

Very grateful that we're willing to do this :) Mentioned that no one knew how to create a website on the E.Motion team, so they appreciate our offer very much.

# Site Design/Plan (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience. Be specific and justify why this audience is a cohesive group with regard to your client's site. This audience should not be overly broad nor arbitrarily specific. It should be a cohesive group with similar _goals_.

Their audience consists of three groups in Cornell's population:
- Other Cornell dance groups interested in collaborating
- Groups interested in sponsoring them
- Cornell students interested in joining their club or who could potentially attend their showcases or events

This is a cohesive group to our client's site that has similar goals, as they are seeking information to learn more about E.Motion. This information can include the club's contact information, upcoming events, or history.

### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project I am (re-)designing a web site for _client's name_. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10-15 minutes. You are free to quit at any time.

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.
